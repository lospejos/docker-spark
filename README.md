# Docker Spark

[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) is a framework for doing distributed Big Data processing. This project contains files to build a Docker image for Spark. It is a fork of [semantive/spark](https://github.com/Semantive/docker-spark) but has been modified to use Alpine as base to make the final image smaller. It can be used in a standalone cluster or with the accompanying `docker-compose.yml` as a base for more complex recipes.

## Simple example

To run `SparkPi`, run the image with Docker:

```
docker run --rm -it -p 4040:4040 aa8y/spark bin/run-example SparkPi 10
```

## Cluster example [docker-compose]

To create a simple standalone cluster with [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose) use:

```
docker-compose up
```

The SparkUI will be running at `http://${YOUR_DOCKER_HOST}:8080` with one worker listed and Spark jobs may be submitted using master `spark://${YOUR_DOCKER_HOST}:7077`. To connect via spark-shell with cluster use:

```
spark-shell --master spark://localhost:7077
```

## Tags

We have tags for each Spark version starting `1.6.0` to `2.3.2`. The tags `1` and `1.6` point to the `1.6.3` which is the latest release for that major/minor version. Similarly `2` and `2.3` point to `2.3.2`. `latest` always points to latest Spark release which in this case is `2.3.2`.

Newer Edge tags have been added. These tags build Spark from the source and should have the most recent code. The motivation behind adding these was to make testing/usage of the newer Spark code which has not been released, easier. We have tags starting from `edge-1.6` to `edge-2.2` for each minor Spark release and correspond to their respective branches on Github. `edge` points to the `master` branch. However these images are very bloated and it's hard to manually trigger their build as we don't know when the `apache/spark` repository changes. Some work needs to be done around keeping them up to date.

You can always refer to the `manifest.yml` file for more information about the images being built (see below).

### Building / Pushing / Tagging docker images

[Docker Helper](https://github.com/aa8y/docker-helper) has been deprecated. The project now uses [Dave](https://github.com/aa8y/dave) which is vastly superior. TravisCI builds, tests and pushes the `stable` tags. To build additional tags, fork the repository, enable TravisCI for your fork, change the `manifest.yml` file and follow [instructions in Dave](https://github.com/aa8y/dave#travisci).

### Dockerfiles

This is for the benefit of Docker Hub where you cannot host multiple `Dockerfile`s.
* [Stable](https://github.com/aa8y/docker-spark/blob/master/stable/Dockerfile)
* [Edge](https://github.com/aa8y/docker-spark/blob/master/edge/Dockerfile)

## Future Work

* Add `nightly` tags built from [official nightly builds](https://people.apache.org/~pwendell/spark-nightly/).
* Provision to keep `edge` and `nightly` tags up to date.
